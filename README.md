# Portfolio Website ðŸŒ¸
## Personal Project

This is my personal website built to showcase my work, skills and projects.

## Things I Plan to Do (If I have time)
- [ ] Improve scroll indicator
- [ ] Improve the projects section
- [ ] Add a more professional photo with a blue background
- [ ] See the exact dates of some events mentioned on the website
- [ ] Improve the skills section (maybe highlight languages)

## Fun facts
1. Iâ€™ll do my best to keep this website updated.
2. This website is never really finished because it changes as I do. (Itâ€™s a portfolio, duh!)
